Restaurant searching Website.
The main goal of this Project was to showcase the implemenataion of learnings of Database Management System (DBMS) course. In this project I have displayed my knowledge of working with Microsoft SQL server, advanced SQL queries and Tableau. I have received highest accolades for this very simplistic project, for writing very best SQL queries and providing perfect visual effect by choosing and implementing best visualizations in Tableau for the concerned business transactions.
Steps that I followed for completion of this project :
1. Extract data from yelp api using get_review.py file
2. Insert that data into the microsoft SQL server using create , insert, update commands
3. Get output for the business transactions using SQL Queries
4. Visualize the business transactions using Tableau
5. Publish Tableau on the Tableau public server
6. Build a recommendation website which allows user to search for all the restraunts in College Park are along with their stars and reviews. Website also recommends restraunts based on business query like - "Most Popular Restraunts", "Restraunts with highest number of reviews", "Nearby Restraunts", "Cuisine based Filtering" and also also allows to search details of all the restraunts or any favorite restraunts.
