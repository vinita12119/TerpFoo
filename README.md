Restaurant searching Website.


The main goal of this project was to showcase the implementation of learnings of the Database Management System (DBMS) course. In this project, I have displayed my knowledge of working with Microsoft SQL Server, advanced SQL queries and Tableau. I have received the highest accolades for this very simplistic project, for writing very best SQL queries and providing perfect visual effects by choosing and implementing the best visualizations forms for dashboards and reports in Tableau for the concerned business transactions.


Steps that I followed for the completion of this project :
1. Extract data from Yelp API using get_review.py file
2. Insert that data into the Microsoft SQL Server using create, insert, update commands
3. Get output for the business transactions using SQL Queries
4. Visualize the business transactions using Tableau
5. Publish Tableau on the Tableau public server
6. Build a recommendation website which allows user to search for all the restaurants in College Park are along with their stars and reviews. The website also recommends restaurants based on business queries like - "Most Popular Restaurants", "Restaurants with the highest number of reviews", "Nearby Restaurants", "Cuisine based Filtering" and also allows user to search details of all the restaurants or any favorite restaurants.
